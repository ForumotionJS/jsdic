# Developers only

We didn't mean developer such as contributors that contribute their ideas in this project. We recommend developers that knows how to work with JavaScript to read this scrap of note. Do remember this things before you're started using JSDic :

* Whoever that didn't want to make a new wrapper function outside a wrapper function (jsdicre.js), you can change it into `if` statement and define the current location. 
* For whoever that wants to run the script in ACP, it's strongly recommended to log the script into your Web Console.

Thank you.
