# JSDic
JSDic, is a function that acts as your dictionary to JavaScript. 

# How to run it?
To run it, it's pretty simple. To run it, you just have to select some words in JavaScript (example like `var`), then it will show a pop-up that will explain the meaning of `var`. Also, for the new update, we're currently making some function such as `ex` and `notes` to keep the example and notes in your console. Example and notes will be WIP also, we'll sure we'll come up for such a new and a big update to pass on.

# Which one to use? `jsdic.js` or `jsdicre.js`?
It's up to you. `jsdic.js` allows you to use this function in all pages. So your visitors can use this script too. `jsdicre.js` allows you to first set `openDictionary();` to run the function. So if it's explained in real-life, `jsdic.js` is a book that always opened, allows anyone to read it. `jsdicre.js` is a book that closed, so you have to open it before read the contents in it. Always remind this : **if you use the jsdicre.js one, you have to set the openDictionary(); first in your Web Console, if you didn't run it, the code won't work.** Also, it's extremely recommended to use jsdicre.js for those who didn't want the code to propagating in higher areas.

# To-update-list

* A new modal box.
* Change it to prototype.
* Add a lot of explanations to pass in the `dict` array object.
* Pass a new array object called `ex`, which shows you how to use it. 
* Pass a new array object called `note`, which adds some extra notes to keep in mind.
